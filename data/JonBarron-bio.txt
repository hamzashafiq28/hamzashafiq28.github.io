I am a graduate student at Chosun University and a dedicated research assistant at the MIP Lab. My passion lies in the realms of computer vision and machine learning, where I strive to make a meaningful impact.

Currently, I am immersed in the captivating world of colorizing legacy photos under the expert guidance of Prof. Bumshik Lee at the MIP Lab. My work extends to restoring old images, encompassing brightness enhancement, super-resolution, and colorization.

My academic journey began at UET Lahore, where I had the privilege of being advised by Zain Murtaza. During my undergraduate years, I received the highest GPA scholarship and was honored with the Best Semester Project Award. My final year project, fully funded by Ignite, marked the beginning of my journey into the fascinating world of technology and image restoration.
